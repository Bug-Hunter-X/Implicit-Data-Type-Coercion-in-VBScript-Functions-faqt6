This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in VBScript: implicit data type coercion in function parameters.  Failure to explicitly declare parameter types can lead to unexpected behavior and runtime errors, particularly when dealing with empty or null values. The `bug.vbs` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version with explicit type declarations and improved error handling.  This example highlights the importance of precise data type management in VBScript to ensure robustness and prevent unexpected results.
